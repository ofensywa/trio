 im releasing this source because alot of stuff is aids and pasted.



 stuff to fix:

 nightmode - spams the console, you gotta click the button again to remove
 the spam.
 
 offscreen esp - never fixed it, it works sometimes, but it usually has a
 random arrow just chilling

 listbox - never fixed / finished it

 blend while scoped - sometimes flips world up (cant rly explain)

 fullbright - when you turn off the world flashes black

 bullet tracers - they don't always work and sometimes will not show up

 footstep esp - has random cuts & is done in event manager (use getactivesound)

 configs - they never worked, tried once, gave up

 disable post processing - removed cause broke sv_cheats

 bomb timer - works, just will keep counting no matter what

 projectiles - if you throw a molotov and wait till the round ends and the
 molotov didnt expire, the circle will stay for the rest of the game

 remove scope - works, but you sometimes get a crosshair flash when loading in

 auto strafer - works, just is aids code

 skeleton esp - in code, just doesnt work (messes up and flips up chams)

 color pickers - copy & paste doesnt update the color picker (inside the picker)

 backtrack chams - in code, just spazzes out and does sketch stuff

 every outlined text - the code is aids, i made the text render 10 times.

 player ammo - doesnt have reload animation (just visual)

 grenade pred - absolute trash, works just very hardcoded

 force crosshair - works, just doesn't remove when scoped, or when you turn off
